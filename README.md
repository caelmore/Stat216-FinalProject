# Stat216-FinalProject
This repository includes all code and sources used in creating my final paper for Stat216 at Kenyon College. 
Stat216-FinalProject.Rmd is the R markdown file in which all calculations, analysis, and writing took place.
scrapingCFBRefData.py is a Python file used to pull data from Sports Reference's college football team offense, defense, and advanced ratings tables by conference and put them into csv's.
