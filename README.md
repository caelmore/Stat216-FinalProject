# Stat216-FinalProject
This repository includes all code and sources used in creating my final paper for Stat216 at Kenyon College. 
Stat216-FinalProject.Rmd is the R markdown file in which all calculations, analysis, and writing took place.
scrapingCFBRefData.py is a Python file used to pull data from Sports Reference's college football team offense, defense, and advanced ratings tables by conference and put them into csv's.
cfb_p5_offensive_data.csv, cfb_p5_defensive_data.csv, and cfb_p5_adv_data.csv are three csv's created using scrapingCFBRefData.py. They contain Sports Reference's offensive, defensive, and advanced ratings metrics for every Power 5 football team from 2014-2023, updated through the 2023 conference championship games.
